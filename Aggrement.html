                        <li>
                            Privacy of your information is very important to us.

                    <b>Sharing Your Content and Information</b><br>
                        you (user) are the owner of all of the contents that you create. In addition:

                            For content that is covered by design property rights, like photos and videos, you
                            specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy settings: you
                            grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide license to use any IP content
                            that you post.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When you delete content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the
                            recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may
                            persist in automated backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but would
                            not be available to others).

                            When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to

                            others have shared with you. We require such applications to respect your
                            privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the
                            application can interact with that content and information.

                            When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that
